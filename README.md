# Scene-Classification-With-Bag-of-Word-Method
Scene recognition using SIFT and KMeans

The aim of this project is to use the given test and training images, extract their features with SIFT, then separate these extracted features into clusters using kmeans, find the weight points of the separated clusters and then perform scene classification with knn.
